The structure of our carousel goes something like this: We have a main div.carousel-wrapper that gives our carousel its size. Inside our wrapper, we have span.hidden-target elements with unique IDs that act as targets for our carousel items controls, and div.carousel-item elements that hold the content of each of our carousel items.

Each of our div.carousel-item elements have some content within them, and two links, a.arrow-prev and a.arrow-next, which we use to cycle between the carousel items.
